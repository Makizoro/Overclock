Overclock CSI Social Platform:

This app is designed to provide a concise platform to display Wit's different social branches; namely clubs, societies and interest groups (CSIs). We believe that there is an opportunity to provide a dedicated platform to host CSI that will provide easy and quick access to information about these CSI and allow users to explore different CSI that they perhaps didn't know existed. This promotes more interactivity across Wits.

In the app, you will be able to register your profile, and log into the app. You will be able to view information about different CSIs and subscribe to them. You can follow events that they are part of as well as where to find them in Wits.

If you are interested in hosting your own CSI, you may fill in a form and submit it to the administrator of the app for evaluation. If successful, your CSI home page will be set up. You can then edit and add information to this page
